{"name":"KURT SCHWARTZ","description":"This slick son of a gun works hard and plays harder. Kurt is a sucker for security and takes his time to work the floor-brokers so he’s able to secure the best possible price on his stock. When he’s not finding ways to schmooze the brokers, he makes his own sort of trouble. Those late-night full moon parties often lead to howls of criminal activity.","image":"http://5.189.140.128/wolves_assets/cards/wolves/level1/KURT-300.jpg","external_url":"https://app.wolvesofwallstreet.finance/detail?type=wolves&levelId=0&cardId=kurt","localization":{"uri":"./0402_{locale}.json","default":"en_US","locales":["en_US","zh_CN"]}}
