{"name":"PAWLY SINATRO","description":"Fierce on the trading floor, Pawly shorts his stocks with zero conscience. He’s unapproachable unless he gets his adrenaline fix and makes bank. Salivating over his pack-mates’ losses, he’s built to win and often celebrates with a strong, long Harvey Wallbanger after he’s made his gains."}
